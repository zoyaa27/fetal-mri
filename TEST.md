## 1. Purpose and scope

This document is a corpus of test cases for the fetal brain MRI biometry calculator specified in `SPEC.md`. Each case is a self-contained fixture comprising

1. a gestational age (GA) in completed weeks plus days,
2. a complete set of input measurements covering every parameter the calculator accepts,
3. the expected per-parameter band classification produced by the multi-source consensus engine (Section 4.2 of `SPEC.md`),
4. the differential-diagnosis cards that should fire and the cards that should *not* fire,
5. the expected one-line IMPRESSION text, and
6. the literature citation that grounds the case in real fetal-MRI data, real published cohort statistics, real peer-reviewed thresholds, or a combination of the three.

Every diagnosis the calculator emits has at least five test cases. Cases are deliberately organised by diagnosis rather than by GA or by parameter, so that a developer or coding agent can lift an entire section into a unit-test file and exercise the engine's behaviour for one diagnosis end-to-end. Cross-cutting tests for the consensus reconciliation algorithm itself (single-source pass-through, two-source agreement, two-source disagreement) are gathered in §29.

### 1.1 Case construction patterns

Four construction patterns are used across the corpus and are labelled in each case heading:

- **VERBATIM** — the measurements are transcribed character-for-character from a single fetus's published exam in a peer-reviewed paper.
- **COHORT-MEAN** — the measurements are set to a published cohort's reported mean values at the cohort's mean GA. A cohort mean at the cohort's mean GA is the most diagnostically representative individual the cohort can offer, and using it tests the correct *direction and magnitude* of every z-score and every DDx card that should fire.
- **THRESHOLD-DERIVED** — the parameter values are chosen so that one or more z-scores cross a threshold defined in a peer-reviewed source (for example, atrial diameter exactly 12 mm to satisfy Pagani 2014's mild-VM definition, or skull BPD exactly two SD below Tilea 2009's mean equation evaluated at the case's GA). Threshold-derived cases are not transcriptions of any one fetus; they are *assertions of what an exam matching the published criterion should look like*.
- **ARITHMETIC-CONTROL** — the measurements are set to the active source-registry mean at the case GA. These cases verify that the runtime engine itself can emit a fully normal report without relying on an external cohort fixture.

All three patterns are valid for unit testing because the calculator's job is to convert measurements into a band classification and a differential-diagnosis output deterministically. A test that asserts "if every parameter equals its cohort mean, then no DDx card should fire and every band should be `normal`" is a strictly stronger test than asserting that on a single fetus.

### 1.2 Source independence

Pathology, threshold, and cohort cases are sourced from papers, cohorts, or thresholds that are **not** part of the calculator's source registry (Section 7.2 of `SPEC.md`). The calculator's normative coefficients come from Luis 2025, Dovjak 2021, and Woitek 2014; Third ventricle is a raw-threshold auxiliary input grounded by the Hertzberg 1997 3.5 mm threshold, not an active z-scored registry row. Test cases are drawn from Tilea 2009, Garel 2004, Kyriakopoulou 2017, Bromley 1994, Nagaraj 2021, Whitehead 2022, Tang 2009, Santo 2012, Griffiths 2016, Aertsen 2019, D'Addario 2001, Pagani 2014, Heaphy-Henault 2018, Carta 2018, Barzilay 2017, Gafner 2022, Pinto 2016 (Blake's pouch upward-rotation cohort), Limperopoulos 2006, Malinger 2013 (HPE), Patel 2019 (PCH fetal MRI), and several radiologic case-report compilations. Agreement between the calculator's output and the expected band on those cases therefore demonstrates *external validity* rather than self-confirmation. Normal controls N1-N6 are arithmetic negative controls against the active source registry and are intentionally not counted as independent external-validation evidence.

### 1.3 Measurement-set conventions

Each case lists the full set of fourteen calculator inputs even when only a few are relevant to the diagnosis under test. Inputs that are not specified by the source case are filled with the active source-registry consensus mean at the case's GA. This is labelled `(filler)` in each row. Filler values are rounded to the nearest 0.1 mm, so they remain within rounding tolerance of z = 0 and should not accidentally trigger an unrelated DDx card. Third-ventricle values are raw-threshold placeholders below the 3.5 mm alert threshold, not z-scored cohort means. A test runner that wants to perturb the corpus to test boundary conditions can do so by changing the filler values and running the corpus again.

The columns "Expected band" and "Expected agreement" refer to the consensus output documented in `SPEC.md` §4.2. Bands are `<5th`, `5th–95th` (also written `normal`), `>95th`, and `<3rd` / `>97th` for the size-summary parameters. Agreement is `single` when only one source covers a parameter, `agree` when two sources cover the parameter and their z-scores differ by less than 1.0 SD, and `disagree` otherwise. Dovjak 2021 source range audit: 14+0 to 39+2 weeks (encoded as 14.0-39.3 weeks), based on PMC8457244 and PubMed PMID 32730667.

GA is written as `W+D` (weeks-and-days) and as a decimal `W.dd` interchangeably, with the convention that `28.0 w` and `28+0` refer to the same GA. The calculator must accept either form.

### 1.4 Filler equations used to populate non-specified parameters

To make each case's full measurement table self-contained without bloating the prose, the table below provides the canonical filler values used throughout the corpus at five representative GAs. Z-scored rows come from the active source-registry consensus mean curves in `SPEC.md` §7.3, rounded to the nearest 0.1 mm. Third-ventricle values are raw-threshold placeholders and should remain below the 3.5 mm alert threshold. Cases below interpolate linearly between adjacent rows.

| GA | Skull BPD | Skull OFD | Brain BPD | Brain OFD-L | Brain OFD-R | Atrium | CSP | CC | TCD | Vermis CC | Vermis AP | Pons AP | 3rd-V |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 21+0 | 51.3 mm | 60.9 mm | 43.1 mm | 52.4 mm | 52.4 mm | 7.9 mm | 6.3 mm | 20.0 mm | 20.5 mm | 8.5 mm | 5.7 mm | 6.8 mm | 1.4 mm |
| 24+0 | 61.5 mm | 74.2 mm | 50.6 mm | 65.1 mm | 65.1 mm | 7.3 mm | 7.1 mm | 26.2 mm | 25.6 mm | 11.3 mm | 7.7 mm | 7.9 mm | 1.5 mm |
| 28+0 | 73.5 mm | 89.1 mm | 60.9 mm | 79.7 mm | 79.7 mm | 6.9 mm | 7.6 mm | 32.5 mm | 32.5 mm | 14.8 mm | 10.2 mm | 9.5 mm | 1.7 mm |
| 32+0 | 83.9 mm | 100.9 mm | 71.8 mm | 91.9 mm | 91.9 mm | 6.7 mm | 7.6 mm | 36.6 mm | 39.5 mm | 18.0 mm | 12.6 mm | 11.2 mm | 1.8 mm |
| 36+0 | 92.6 mm | 109.6 mm | 83.2 mm | 101.5 mm | 101.5 mm | 6.7 mm | 7.2 mm | 38.6 mm | 46.7 mm | 20.9 mm | 14.8 mm | 12.9 mm | 2.0 mm |

Cases at intermediate GAs use linear interpolation between adjacent rows. The filler equations themselves are stated in `SPEC.md` §7.3 and are not duplicated here.

### 1.5 Coverage matrix

The coverage matrix at the end of this document (§30) confirms that every diagnosis emitted by the calculator has at least five cases, every base DDx trigger has at least one positive control and one negative control, every measured parameter participates in at least four cases, and the consensus engine's three observable behaviours (`single`, `agree`, `disagree`) are each exercised by at least three cases.

---

## 2. Normal controls

These six cases are negative controls. Normal controls N1-N6 are arithmetic negative controls against the active source registry. They establish that when every z-scored parameter is at the runtime consensus mean for the GA, the calculator emits no differential-diagnosis cards, every band is `normal`, the IMPRESSION line reads "No abnormal biometric findings.", and the SOURCE-AGREEMENT NOTES block lists every multi-source parameter as `agree`.

### Case N1 — Normal control, 22 + 3 weeks (ARITHMETIC-CONTROL)

### Case N4 — Normal control, 36 + 0 weeks (ARITHMETIC-CONTROL)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band | Expected agreement |
|---|---|---|---|
| GA | 36 w 0 d | — | — |
| Skull BPD | 92.6 mm | normal | single |
| Skull OFD | 109.6 mm | normal | single |
| Brain BPD | 83.2 mm | normal | single |

### Case N5 — Normal control at the engine's lower GA boundary, 21 + 0 weeks (ARITHMETIC-CONTROL)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band | Expected agreement |
|---|---|---|---|
| GA | 21 w 0 d | — | — |
| Skull BPD | 51.3 mm | normal | single |
| Skull OFD | 60.9 mm | normal | single |
| Brain BPD | 43.1 mm | normal | single |
| Brain OFD-L | 52.4 mm | normal | single |
| Brain OFD-R | 52.4 mm | normal | single |
| Atrium-R | 7.9 mm | normal | single |
| Atrium-L | 7.9 mm | normal | single |
| CSP | 6.3 mm (present) | normal | single |
| CC | 20.0 mm (present) | normal | single |
| TCD | 20.5 mm | normal | agree |
| Vermis CC | 8.5 mm | normal | agree |
| Vermis AP | 5.7 mm | normal | agree |
| Pons AP | 6.8 mm | normal | agree |
| Third ventricle | 1.4 mm | normal raw threshold | auxiliary threshold |

**Expected DDx cards that should fire:** none.
**Boundary behaviour to test:** This case sits at the lower clinical boundary of the normal-control corpus. The TCD, vermis CC, vermis AP, and pons AP rows should report `agree` because both Luis 2025 and Dovjak 2021 are in range at 21+0. A separate boundary case at 20+6 should still have Dovjak in range but Luis just below range, so the source disclosure should carry an `extrapolated: true` flag on Luis rather than on Dovjak.

### Case N6 — Normal control at the engine's upper GA boundary, 38 + 0 weeks (ARITHMETIC-CONTROL)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band | Expected agreement |
|---|---|---|---|
| GA | 38 w 0 d | — | — |
| Skull BPD | 96.4 mm | normal | single |
| Skull OFD | 112.7 mm | normal | single |
| Brain BPD | 89.1 mm | normal | single |
| Brain OFD-L | 105.4 mm | normal | single |
| Brain OFD-R | 105.4 mm | normal | single |
| Atrium-R | 6.8 mm | normal | single |
| Atrium-L | 6.8 mm | normal | single |
| CSP | 6.8 mm (present) | normal | single |
| CC | 38.7 mm (present) | normal | single |
| TCD | 50.3 mm | normal | agree |
| Vermis CC | 22.2 mm | normal | agree |
| Vermis AP | 15.9 mm | normal | agree |
| Pons AP | 13.7 mm | normal | agree |
| Third ventricle | 2.1 mm | normal raw threshold | auxiliary threshold |

**Expected DDx cards that should fire:** none.
**Boundary behaviour to test:** Kyriakopoulou's reference window ends at 38+0; Luis 2025's quadratic is validated to 40+0; Dovjak 2021 is encoded from 14.0 to 39.3 weeks. This case should produce `agree` on Dovjak-covered parameters with both Luis and Dovjak in range. The source disclosure should not mark Dovjak as extrapolated until the case GA exceeds the audited 39+2 upper source range.

## 3. Mild-to-moderate ventriculomegaly (atrial diameter ≥ 10 mm and < 15 mm)

The calculator's `mild_ventriculomegaly` card fires when either atrial-R or atrial-L is between 10.0 and 14.9 mm. The card's report quotes Pagani 2014's pooled ND-delay rate of 7.9% (95% CI 4.7–11.1%) for the *isolated* subset.

### Case M1 — Isolated bilateral mild VM at 24 weeks (THRESHOLD-DERIVED)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 24 w 0 d | — |
| Skull BPD | 61.5 mm | normal |
| Skull OFD | 74.2 mm | normal |
| Brain BPD | 50.6 mm | normal |
| Brain OFD-L | 65.1 mm | normal |
| Brain OFD-R | 65.1 mm | normal |
| **Atrium-R** | **11.0 mm** | **>95th** |
| **Atrium-L** | **11.0 mm** | **>95th** |
| CSP | 7.1 mm (present) | normal |
| CC | 26.2 mm (present) | normal |
| TCD | 25.6 mm | normal |
| Vermis CC | 11.3 mm | normal |
| Vermis AP | 7.7 mm | normal |
| Pons AP | 7.9 mm | normal |
| Third ventricle | 1.5 mm | normal |

**Expected DDx cards that should fire:** `mild_ventriculomegaly` (both atrium-R and atrium-L row references).
**Expected DDx cards that should not fire:** `severe_ventriculomegaly`, `asymmetric_ventricles`, `acc_pattern`, `aqueductal_stenosis_pattern`, all posterior-fossa cards.
**Expected IMPRESSION:** "Isolated mild ventriculomegaly; consider postnatal MRI follow-up. Pooled neurodevelopmental delay rate ~7.9% (Pagani 2014)."
**Citation.** Pagani G, Thilaganathan B, Prefumo F. Neurodevelopmental outcome in isolated mild fetal ventriculomegaly: systematic review and meta-analysis. *Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol.* 2014;44(3):254–260. doi:10.1002/uog.13364. The 11.0 mm bilateral threshold matches Pagani 2014's mild-VM definition; the meta-analysis pooled 699 isolated mild-VM cases.

### Case M2 — Isolated bilateral mild VM at 32 weeks, atrium near upper threshold (THRESHOLD-DERIVED)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 32 w 0 d | — |
| Skull BPD | 83.9 mm | normal |
| Skull OFD | 100.9 mm | normal |
| Brain BPD | 71.8 mm | normal |
| Brain OFD-L | 91.9 mm | normal |
| Brain OFD-R | 91.9 mm | normal |
| **Atrium-R** | **14.5 mm** | **>95th** |
| **Atrium-L** | **14.5 mm** | **>95th** |
| CSP | 7.6 mm | normal |
| CC | 36.6 mm | normal |
| TCD | 39.5 mm | normal |
| Vermis CC | 18.0 mm | normal |
| Vermis AP | 12.6 mm | normal |
| Pons AP | 11.2 mm | normal |
| Third ventricle | 1.8 mm | normal |

**Expected DDx cards that should fire:** `moderate_ventriculomegaly`. Card prose should note that atrial dimensions are "approaching the severe threshold (15 mm)" and that follow-up imaging is warranted to detect progression.
**Expected DDx cards that should not fire:** `severe_ventriculomegaly` (atrial < 15.0 mm).
**Boundary behaviour to test.** This case sits 0.5 mm below the severe-VM threshold; a +0.5 mm perturbation should push both rows into `severe_ventriculomegaly`. This boundary is the highest-risk classification edge in the entire DDx table.

### Case M3 — Unilateral mild VM with normal contralateral atrium at 28 weeks (THRESHOLD-DERIVED)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 28 w 0 d | — |
| Skull BPD | 73.5 mm | normal |
| Skull OFD | 89.1 mm | normal |

| Vermis CC | 14.8 mm | normal |
| Vermis AP | 10.2 mm | normal |
| Pons AP | 9.5 mm | normal |
| Third ventricle | 1.7 mm | normal |

**Expected DDx cards that should fire:** `mild_ventriculomegaly` (right side), and **`asymmetric_ventricles`** (right−left = 4.6 mm > 2 mm threshold).
**Expected DDx cards that should not fire:** `severe_ventriculomegaly`.
**Expected IMPRESSION:** "Right-sided mild ventriculomegaly with marked side-to-side asymmetry; recommend dedicated workup for unilateral causes (intra-ventricular obstruction, encephaloclastic insult, germinal matrix haemorrhage)."

Barzilay 2017 explicitly studies the diagnostic yield of fetal MRI in unilateral and asymmetric VM and supports the > 2 mm asymmetry threshold.

### Case M4 — Bilateral moderate VM at 26 weeks with normal CSP and CC (THRESHOLD-DERIVED)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 26 w 0 d | — |

| Vermis CC | 13.0 mm | normal |
| Vermis AP | 9.0 mm | normal |
| Pons AP | 8.7 mm | normal |
| Third ventricle | 1.6 mm | normal |

**Expected DDx cards that should fire:** `moderate_ventriculomegaly` (12.1–14.9 mm range).
**Expected DDx cards that should not fire:** `severe_ventriculomegaly`, `asymmetric_ventricles` (Δ = 0 mm).
**Citation.** Barzilay 2017. The paper's mild-vs-moderate-vs-severe ventriculomegaly subgrouping uses 10–11.9 / 12–14.9 / ≥ 15 mm; the 13.5 mm value is the midpoint of the moderate sub-band.

### Case M5 — Mild VM at 22 weeks with otherwise unremarkable exam (THRESHOLD-DERIVED, low-GA edge)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 22 w 0 d | — |
| Skull BPD | 54.8 mm | normal |
| Skull OFD | 65.5 mm | normal |
| Brain BPD | 45.6 mm | normal |

**Expected DDx cards that should fire:** `mild_ventriculomegaly` (right), `asymmetric_ventricles` (Δ = 3.8 mm).
**Citation.** Pagani 2014; SMFM 2020.

### Case M6 — Bilateral mild VM at 30 weeks with mild contralateral asymmetry, no other abnormalities (THRESHOLD-DERIVED)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 30 w 0 d | — |
| Skull BPD | 78.9 mm | normal |
| Skull OFD | 95.4 mm | normal |
| Brain BPD | 66.3 mm | normal |
| Brain OFD-L | 86.1 mm | normal |
| Brain OFD-R | 86.1 mm | normal |
| **Atrium-R** | **11.5 mm** | **>95th** |
| **Atrium-L** | **10.0 mm** | **>95th** |
| CSP | 7.7 mm | normal |
| CC | 34.9 mm | normal |
| TCD | 36.0 mm | normal |
| Vermis CC | 16.4 mm | normal |
| Vermis AP | 11.4 mm | normal |
| Pons AP | 10.4 mm | normal |
| Third ventricle | 1.7 mm | normal |

**Expected DDx cards that should fire:** `mild_ventriculomegaly` on both rows. `asymmetric_ventricles` should *not* fire because Δ = 1.5 mm < 2 mm.
**Citation.** Pagani 2014. This case is the bilateral-mild-VM analog of Case M3, with sub-threshold asymmetry, included to verify the asymmetric-VM threshold from below.

---

## 4. Severe ventriculomegaly (atrial diameter ≥ 15 mm)

The calculator's `severe_ventriculomegaly` card fires when atrial-R or atrial-L is ≥ 15.0 mm. Severe VM is associated with a high yield of underlying anomalies (aqueductal stenosis, ACC, HPE, intraventricular haemorrhage); the report should not assume an aetiology unless the combined-pattern cards are also triggered.

### Case S1 — Severe bilateral VM at 26 weeks with macrocephaly and dilated third ventricle, secondary to aqueductal stenosis (COHORT-MEAN, Heaphy-Henault 2018)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 26 w 0 d | — |

## 5. Asymmetric ventricles

The `asymmetric_ventricles` card fires when |atrium-R − atrium-L| > 2 mm. Asymmetry is itself benign in many cases but raises concern for ipsilateral pathology (haemorrhage, encephaloclastic insult, focal cortical malformation). All five cases below have at least one atrial measurement *within* normal range, isolating the asymmetry trigger.

### Case AS1 — Pure asymmetry without VM at 28 weeks (THRESHOLD-DERIVED)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 28 w 0 d | — |
| Atrium-R | 9.5 mm | below 10 mm VM threshold |
| Atrium-L | 6.5 mm | normal |
| (others) | filler | normal |

Δ = 3.0 mm > 2 mm → `asymmetric_ventricles` fires; no VM card.
**Citation.** Meyer R, Yinon Y, Achiron R, Katorza E. Neurodevelopmental outcome of fetal isolated ventricular asymmetry without dilatation. *Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol.* 2018;52(5):634–639. doi:10.1002/uog.19065.

### Case AS2 — Asymmetry with sub-threshold mild VM at 26 weeks

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 26 w 0 d | — |
| Atrium-R | 9.8 mm | below 10 mm VM threshold (just below cutoff) |
| Atrium-L | 6.5 mm | normal |
| (others) | filler | normal |

Δ = 3.3 mm → `asymmetric_ventricles` fires; `mild_ventriculomegaly` does *not* fire (right is 0.2 mm sub-threshold). This is a critical edge case for the threshold logic.
**Citation.** Meyer 2018.

### Case AS3 — Severe right VM with mild left VM (already shown as S4 above; cross-referenced here for completeness)

Cross-reference: see §4, Case S4. `asymmetric_ventricles`, `severe_ventriculomegaly`, `mild_ventriculomegaly` all fire.

### Case AS4 — Mild VM with sub-threshold asymmetry (already shown as M3 above; cross-referenced here)

Cross-reference: see §3, Case M3. `mild_ventriculomegaly`, `asymmetric_ventricles` fire.

### Case AS5 — Sub-threshold side-to-side difference (negative control) at 24 weeks

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 24 w 0 d | — |
| Atrium-R | 8.0 mm | normal |
| Atrium-L | 6.5 mm | normal |
| (others) | filler | normal |

Δ = 1.5 mm < 2 mm → `asymmetric_ventricles` should *not* fire. Negative control for the asymmetry trigger.
**Citation.** Achiron R, Yagel S, Rotstein Z, Inbar O, Mashiach S, Lipitz S. Cerebral lateral ventricular asymmetry: is this a normal ultrasonographic finding in the fetal brain? *Obstet Gynecol.* 1997;89(2):233–237, which establishes side-to-side difference < 2 mm as a normal-variant range.

### Case AS6 — Marked asymmetry at 32 weeks (Δ = 7 mm), unilateral severe VM with normal contralateral

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 32 w 0 d | — |
| Atrium-R | 15.0 mm | >95th |
| Atrium-L | 7.6 mm | normal |
| (others) | filler | normal |

`severe_ventriculomegaly` (right), `asymmetric_ventricles` (Δ = 7.4 mm). The combined pattern is suspicious for unilateral haemorrhage or encephaloclastic insult.
**Citation.** Barzilay 2017.

## 6. Inferior vermian hypoplasia (vermian height z < –2 SD)

The `vermian_hypoplasia` card fires when vermis CC or vermis AP is < 5th percentile. All five cases below combine a clearly small vermis with a normal-or-low TVA (distinguishing pure hypoplasia from Dandy-Walker, where TVA is markedly elevated).

### Case V1 — Bromley 1994 24-week vermian hypoplasia exemplar (VERBATIM)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 24 w 0 d | — |
| Vermis CC | 10.9 mm (source-specific low; active registry z ≈ –0.5) | normal |
| Vermis AP | 4.8 mm | <5th |
| TVA | 18° (normal-low) | qualitative |
| TCD | 27.5 mm | normal |
| Pons AP | 7.5 mm | normal |
| (other rows) | filler | normal |

`vermian_hypoplasia` fires. `dandy_walker_spectrum` should *not* fire because TVA < 45° excludes DWM.

### Case V2 — Nagaraj 2021 vermian-hypoplasia cohort fixture at 24.7 weeks (COHORT-MEAN)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 24 w 5 d | — |
| Vermis CC | 9.0 mm (Nagaraj VH cohort mean) | <5th |
| Vermis AP | 4.5 mm | <5th |
| TVA | 52.13° (Nagaraj VH cohort mean) | borderline qualitative |
| TCD | 26.8 mm | normal |
| Pons AP | 8.2 mm | normal |
| (other rows) | filler | normal |

`vermian_hypoplasia` fires. `dandy_walker_spectrum` should not fire (Nagaraj-VH cohort TVA mean 52° vs. DWM-cohort 109.5° — squarely separates the two).

### Case V3 — Isolated inferior vermian hypoplasia at 26 weeks (THRESHOLD-DERIVED, Limperopoulos 2006 cohort GA)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 26 w 0 d | — |
| Vermis CC | 11.5 mm (vs. expected 14.0 mm, z ≈ –2.2) | <5th |
| Vermis AP | 5.3 mm (vs. expected 6.5 mm, z ≈ –2.0) | <5th |
| TCD | 30.5 mm | normal |
| Pons AP | 8.4 mm | normal |
| (other rows) | filler | normal |

`vermian_hypoplasia` fires. The IMPRESSION should reference Limperopoulos 2006's caveat that fetal MRI before 24 weeks substantially over-calls inferior vermian hypoplasia.
**Citation.** Limperopoulos C, Robertson RL, Estroff JA, et al. Diagnosis of inferior vermian hypoplasia by fetal MRI: potential pitfalls and neurodevelopmental outcome. *Am J Obstet Gynecol.* 2006;194(4):1070–1076. doi:10.1016/j.ajog.2005.10.191. Limperopoulos's cohort had a median diagnostic GA of 22 w with a 32% false-positive rate; the case is set at 26 w to be outside that pitfall window.

### Case V4 — Vermian hypoplasia with mild VM at 28 weeks (combined finding)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 28 w 0 d | — |
| Atrium-R | 11.0 mm | >95th |
| Atrium-L | 11.0 mm | >95th |
| Vermis CC | 12.5 mm (z ≈ –2.5) | <5th |
| Vermis AP | 5.5 mm (z ≈ –2.5) | <5th |
| TCD | 33.0 mm | normal |
| Pons AP | 9.0 mm | normal |
| (other rows) | filler | normal |

`vermian_hypoplasia`, `mild_ventriculomegaly` fire.

### Case V5 — Severe vermian hypoplasia at 32 weeks (vermis CC z ≈ –4)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 32 w 0 d | — |
| Vermis CC | 11.0 mm (vs. expected 19.4 mm) | <5th |
| Vermis AP | 5.0 mm | <5th |
| TVA | 30° | qualitative |
| TCD | 35.5 mm | <5th (mild associated cerebellar volume loss) |
| Pons AP | 11.2 mm | normal |
| (other rows) | filler | normal |

`vermian_hypoplasia`, `small_tcd` fire. The combined small-TCD + small-vermis pattern raises concern for cerebellar agenesis or PCH; the report should flag the combined pattern even if no single combined-pattern card formally fires.
**Citation.** Patel S, Barkovich AJ. Analysis and classification of cerebellar malformations. *AJNR Am J Neuroradiol.* 2002;23(7):1074–1087.

### Case V6 — Borderline-low vermis at 22 weeks (negative control, GA pitfall)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 22 w 0 d | — |
| Vermis CC | 9.5 mm (z ≈ –1.6) | normal (5th–95th) |
| Vermis AP | 6.0 mm | normal |
| TCD | 22.2 mm | normal |
| Pons AP | 7.2 mm | normal |
| (other rows) | filler | normal |

`vermian_hypoplasia` should *not* fire (z is –1.6, above the –1.645 cut). This case verifies that the calculator does not over-call hypoplasia at borderline values, especially in the early-second-trimester window where Limperopoulos 2006 documents a high false-positive rate.

## 7. Dandy-Walker malformation (classical) and Dandy-Walker spectrum

The `dandy_walker_spectrum` card fires when a small/absent vermis is combined with a markedly elevated TVA (> 45°) and an enlarged posterior fossa. Nagaraj 2021's DWM cohort had vermis CC 7.67 mm, AP vermis 2.83 mm, TVA 109.5°, TCD 24.71 mm, pons AP 5.4 mm at 24.7 weeks.

### Case D1 — Classical DWM at 24+5 weeks (COHORT-MEAN, Nagaraj 2021)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |

| GA | 24 w 5 d | — |
| Vermis CC | 7.67 mm | <5th |

| TCD | 24.71 mm | source-specific <5th |
| Pons AP | 5.4 mm | <5th |
| (other rows) | filler | normal |

`vermian_hypoplasia`, `small_tcd`, `small_pons`, **`pch_pattern`** fire; **`dandy_walker_spectrum`** combined-pattern card fires.

| TCD | 20.0 mm | <5th |
| Pons AP | 5.0 mm | <5th |
| (other rows) | filler | normal |

`vermian_hypoplasia`, `small_tcd`, `small_pons`, **`pch_pattern`**, `dandy_walker_spectrum` fire.

`severe_ventriculomegaly`, `csp_absent`, `cc_absent`, `small_tcd`, `small_pons`, `vermian_hypoplasia`, **`acc_pattern`**, **`pch_pattern`**, **`dandy_walker_spectrum`** fire. This case verifies that multiple combined-pattern cards can fire simultaneously and that the IMPRESSION enumerates the major patterns.
**Citation.** Whitehead 2022; Tang 2009.

### Case D4 — Inferior vermian hypoplasia with sub-threshold TVA — DWM negative control at 26 weeks

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 26 w 0 d | — |
| Vermis CC | 9.0 mm | <5th |
| Vermis AP | 4.0 mm | <5th |
| TVA | 25° | qualitative |
| TCD | 30.0 mm | normal |
| Pons AP | 8.5 mm | normal |
| (other rows) | filler | normal |

`vermian_hypoplasia` fires. `dandy_walker_spectrum` should *not* fire because TVA < 35° (Whitehead 2022 refined threshold). Negative-control verification for the DWM combined-pattern card.
**Citation.** Whitehead 2022.

### Case D5 — DWM at 32 weeks with marked posterior fossa cyst, isolated (no other malformations)

## 8. Blake's pouch cyst (mildly raised TVA, otherwise normal vermis and PF)

Blake's pouch cyst (BPC) is a benign posterior-fossa cystic remnant with mildly elevated TVA but a normal-size, normally-formed vermis and a near-normal posterior fossa. The calculator does not fire `vermian_hypoplasia` or `dandy_walker_spectrum` for BPC; instead, an *advisory* qualitative card "Blake's pouch (DD)" appears in the panel when the user manually toggles "elevated TVA + normal vermis size."

### Case BP1 — Nagaraj 2021 BPC cohort fixture (COHORT-MEAN)

### Case BP2 — Persistent Blake's pouch with mildly reduced vermis height at 26 weeks

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 26 w 0 d | — |
| Vermis CC | 12.5 mm (z ≈ –1.5) | normal (just above 5th centile) |

| TVA | 28° | qualitative |
| TCD | 30.0 mm | normal |
| Pons AP | 8.5 mm | normal |
| (other rows) | filler | normal |

No DDx cards should fire. Boundary case verifying that `vermian_hypoplasia` correctly stays silent at z ≈ –1.5.

### Case BP3 — Blake's pouch with mega cisterna magna at 28 weeks

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 28 w 0 d | — |
| Vermis CC | 16.0 mm | normal |
| Vermis AP | 10.2 mm | normal |
| TVA | 30° | qualitative |
| Cisterna magna AP | 12 mm (>10 mm threshold for MCM) | qualitative |
| TCD | 34.5 mm | normal |
| Pons AP | 9.5 mm | normal |
| (other rows) | filler | normal |

`mega_cisterna_magna` fires from the cisterna-magna-depth threshold. No DWM, PCH, vermian-hypoplasia, small-TCD, or small-pons cards should fire. The IMPRESSION should mention "isolated mega cisterna magna with persistent Blake's pouch — likely benign normal variant" if the radiologist toggles the qualitative MCM panel.

| TVA | 30° | qualitative |
| TCD | 41.4 mm | normal |
| Pons AP | 11.5 mm | normal |
| (other rows) | filler | normal |

No DDx cards fire. This case is a clean negative control — the only abnormality is the qualitative TVA elevation, and the calculator does not currently fire a card from TVA alone.
**Citation.** Pinto 2016.

### Case BP6 — Vermian hypoplasia with raised TVA at 28 weeks (DWM-vs-BPC discriminator)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|

| TVA | 60° | qualitative borderline |
| TCD | 32.5 mm | normal |
| Pons AP | 9.0 mm | normal |
| (other rows) | filler | normal |

`vermian_hypoplasia` and `dandy_walker_spectrum` fire under the calculator's locked Whitehead elevated-TVA support rule. `small_tcd`, `small_pons`, and `pch_pattern` should not fire. This case is an explicit discriminator test for the calculator's TVA threshold.
**Citation.** Whitehead 2022 vs. Klein 2003; Pinto 2016.

## 16. Holoprosencephaly (alobar, semilobar, lobar)

The combined `hpe_pattern` card fires when monoventricle, absent CSP, fused thalami, and microcephaly are co-present. The calculator's quantitative engine fires `severe_ventriculomegaly`, `csp_absent`, and `microcephaly_pattern` from the measurements; the monoventricle and fused-thalami findings are qualitative entries that the radiologist toggles.

## 17. Small pons (pontocerebellar hypoplasia spectrum)

The `small_pons` card fires when pons AP z < –1.645. Combined with vermis or TCD reduction, it triggers the qualitative **`pch_pattern`** card. The PCH spectrum includes 11 known subtypes (van Dijk 2018 [34]).

## 20. Macrocephaly (skull BPD and HC > 97th percentile)

The `macrocephaly_pattern` card fires when skull BPD and HC are both > 97th percentile. Causes: hydrocephalus, megalencephaly, overgrowth syndromes (Sotos, BWS), benign familial macrocephaly.

## 21. Third ventricle dilatation (width > 3.5 mm)

The `third_ventricle_dilatation` card fires when 3rd-V width > 3.5 mm. The Hertzberg 1997 threshold of 3.5 mm is the canonical fetal 3rd-V upper bound. Third ventricle is a raw-threshold auxiliary input: the calculator records the measurement and can fire the DDx card, but it does not compute or report a z-score for this row.

## 22. Aqueductal stenosis pattern / triventricular hydrocephalus

The `aqueductal_stenosis_pattern` combined-pattern card fires when severe VM is co-present with third-ventricle dilatation, preserved CSP, and macrocephaly. Per Heaphy-Henault 2018, this combination accurately predicts a postnatal diagnosis of aqueductal stenosis.

### Case AS-P1 — Classical aqueductal stenosis at 26 weeks (cross-reference S1)

Cross-reference: see §4, Case S1. All four pattern-defining features are present: severe VM + 3rd-V > 3.5 mm + preserved CSP + macrocephaly.

### Case AS-P2 — Aqueductal stenosis at 30 weeks with mild bilateral VM but pronounced 3rd-V dilatation (early-evolving form)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 30 w 0 d | — |
| Atrium-R | 14 mm | >95th |
| Atrium-L | 14 mm | >95th |
| CSP | 7.7 mm | normal |
| CC | 36 mm | normal |
| Third ventricle | 5.5 mm | >95th |
| Skull BPD | 79 mm | normal |
| (others) | filler | normal |

`mild_ventriculomegaly`, `third_ventricle_dilatation`, and **`aqueductal_stenosis_pattern`** fire. Per SPEC.md §4.6, the aqueductal-stenosis pattern requires atrial diameter >95th percentile + third ventricle >3.5 mm + preserved CSP, without a separate severe-VM requirement.
**Citation.** Heaphy-Henault 2018.

### Case AS-P3 — Severe VM with absent CSP — negative control for aqueductal stenosis (the absent CSP rules out aqueductal stenosis and points instead to ACC/HPE)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 28 w 0 d | — |
| Atrium-R | 18 mm | >95th |
| Atrium-L | 18 mm | >95th |
| CSP | absent | special-cased |
| Third ventricle | 4.0 mm | >95th |
| (others) | filler | normal |

`severe_ventriculomegaly`, `csp_absent`, `third_ventricle_dilatation` fire. **`aqueductal_stenosis_pattern`** should *not* fire (CSP absent breaks the pattern). Negative-control verification.
**Citation.** Heaphy-Henault 2018.

### Case AS-P4 — Severe VM with normal 3rd-V — negative control for aqueductal stenosis

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 28 w 0 d | — |
| Atrium-R | 17 mm | >95th |
| Atrium-L | 17 mm | >95th |
| CSP | 7.6 mm | normal |
| Third ventricle | 2.0 mm | normal |
| (others) | filler | normal |

`severe_ventriculomegaly` fires; `aqueductal_stenosis_pattern` does *not* fire. Verifies that severe VM alone is insufficient to trigger the pattern.

### Case AS-P5 — Aqueductal stenosis at 24 weeks (early third-trimester onset)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 24 w 0 d | — |
| Atrium-R | 16 mm | >95th |

| CSP | 7.1 mm | normal |
| Third ventricle | 4.5 mm | >95th |

| (others) | filler | normal |

`severe_ventriculomegaly`, `third_ventricle_dilatation`, `macrocephaly_pattern`, **`aqueductal_stenosis_pattern`** fire.
**Citation.** Heaphy-Henault 2018.

### Case AS-P6 — Aqueductal stenosis at 36 weeks with very severe progression

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 36 w 0 d | — |
| Atrium-R | 25 mm | >95th |
| Atrium-L | 25 mm | >95th |
| CSP | 5.4 mm | normal |
| Third ventricle | 7.0 mm | >95th |
| Skull BPD | 110 mm | >97th |
| (others) | filler | normal |

`severe_ventriculomegaly`, `third_ventricle_dilatation`, `macrocephaly_pattern`, **`aqueductal_stenosis_pattern`** fire. Late-gestation severe progression.
**Citation.** Heaphy-Henault 2018.

`small_tcd`, `vermian_hypoplasia` (CC component), **`chiari_ii_open_ntd`** fire.
**Citation.** Aertsen 2019.

### Case CII2 — Aertsen 2019 post-op (post-fetal-surgery) at 30 weeks (COHORT-MEAN)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |

| **CSA** | **76.6°** (Aertsen 2019 post-op mean) | normalising |
| **TDPF** | recovering toward normal | borderline |
| Cerebellar herniation level | –0.7 mm | qualitative |
| (others) | filler | normal |

`chiari_ii_open_ntd` does *not* fire when the post-operative CSA/TDPF pattern normalizes and the Mahalanobis posterior is <0.5. This is the post-surgical-normalisation negative-control fixture.
**Citation.** Aertsen 2019.

### Case CII3 — Severe Chiari II at 24 weeks (COHORT-MEAN)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|

| (others) | filler | normal |

`mild_ventriculomegaly`, `small_tcd`, `vermian_hypoplasia`, `small_pons`, **`chiari_ii_open_ntd`** fire.
**Citation.** Aertsen 2019; D'Addario V, Pinto V, Di Cagno L, Pintucci A.

### Case CII4 — Chiari II at 32 weeks with severe hydrocephalus (combined pattern)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 32 w 0 d | — |
| Atrium-R | 18 mm | >95th |
| Atrium-L | 18 mm | >95th |
| CSP | 7.6 mm | normal |
| Third ventricle | 4.0 mm | >95th |

| CSA | 68° | abnormal |
| TDPF | 36 mm (z ≈ –4.0) | <5th |

`severe_ventriculomegaly`, `third_ventricle_dilatation`, `macrocephaly_pattern`, `aqueductal_stenosis_pattern`, `small_tcd`, `vermian_hypoplasia`, **`chiari_ii_open_ntd`** fire — multi-pattern fixture verifying the engine handles overlapping triggers.
**Citation.** Aertsen 2019; Heaphy-Henault 2018.

### Case CII5 — Chiari II with normal CSA — negative control

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 28 w 0 d | — |
| TCD | 33 mm (z ≈ –1.8) | <5th |
| Vermis CC | 15 mm | borderline |
| CSA | 85° (normal range) | normal |
| TDPF | normal for GA | normal |
| (others) | filler | normal |

`small_tcd` fires; `chiari_ii_open_ntd` does *not* fire (CSA is normal, breaking the pattern). Negative-control verification.
**Citation.** D'Addario 2001.

### Case CII6 — Subtle Chiari II at 22 weeks (early presentation, before crowding fully develops)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 22 w 0 d | — |
| TCD | 22 mm | normal |
| Vermis CC | 10 mm | normal |
| CSA | 70° | borderline-low |
| TDPF | mildly reduced | borderline |
| (others) | filler | normal |

`chiari_ii_open_ntd` is treated as a calibration-boundary fixture: it fires only after a locked Mahalanobis posterior ≥0.5 is documented in the validation analysis lock. Without that locked posterior, this case remains exploratory and is not a clinical positive control.
**Citation.** Aertsen 2019.

## 24. Hemispheric asymmetry (brain OFD-L vs OFD-R discordant by > 2 SD)

The `hemispheric_asymmetry` card fires when the difference between the two cerebral hemispheric OFD measurements exceeds the engine's asymmetry threshold (per SPEC.md §4.6, > 2 SD difference). Causes: unilateral schizencephaly, porencephaly, encephaloclastic insult, focal cortical dysplasia.

### Case HA1 — Right-hemisphere disruption (porencephaly) at 28 weeks

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 28 w 0 d | — |
| Brain OFD-L | 79.7 mm | normal |
| Brain OFD-R | 73.9 mm (z ≈ –2.2) | <5th |
| Atrium-R | 14 mm | >95th |
| Atrium-L | 8 mm | normal |
| (others) | filler | normal |

`hemispheric_asymmetry`, `mild_ventriculomegaly` (right), `asymmetric_ventricles` fire. Combined pattern strongly suggests right-hemisphere encephaloclastic insult.
**Citation.** Barzilay 2017; Garel 2004.

### Case HA2 — Left-hemisphere schizencephaly at 26 weeks

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 26 w 0 d | — |
| Brain OFD-L | 67.5 mm (z ≈ –2.2) | <5th |
| Brain OFD-R | 72.7 mm | normal |
| Atrium-L | 12 mm | >95th |
| Atrium-R | 7 mm | normal |
| (others) | filler | normal |

`hemispheric_asymmetry`, `mild_ventriculomegaly` (left), `asymmetric_ventricles` fire.
**Citation.** Barzilay 2017.

### Case HA3 — Bilateral but asymmetric atrophy at 30 weeks

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 30 w 0 d | — |
| Brain OFD-L | 80.5 mm | <5th |
| Brain OFD-R | 81.0 mm | <5th |
| Atrium-R | 12 mm | >95th |
| Atrium-L | 14 mm | >95th |
| (others) | filler | normal |

`mild_ventriculomegaly` / moderate-range ventriculomegaly context fires from the atrial measurements. `hemispheric_asymmetry` does *not* fire unless the brain OFD left-right z-score gap exceeds the locked >2 SD threshold; this fixture remains below that threshold and is a negative control for the hemispheric-asymmetry card.
**Citation.** Garel 2004.

### Case HA4 — Symmetric brain (negative control) at 28 weeks

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 28 w 0 d | — |
| Brain OFD-L | 79.7 mm | normal |
| Brain OFD-R | 79.7 mm | normal |
| (others) | filler | normal |

`hemispheric_asymmetry` should *not* fire. Negative control.

### Case HA5 — Borderline asymmetry (Δ = 1.5 SD) — negative control

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 30 w 0 d | — |
| Brain OFD-L | 88.3 mm | normal |
| Brain OFD-R | 83.9 mm | normal |
| (others) | filler | normal |

`hemispheric_asymmetry` should *not* fire. Boundary verification.

### Case HA6 — Severe hemispheric asymmetry with associated severe VM (encephaloclastic injury)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 30 w 0 d | — |
| Brain OFD-L | 86.1 mm | normal |
| Brain OFD-R | 79.7 mm | <5th |
| Atrium-R | 16 mm | >95th |
| Atrium-L | 8 mm | normal |
| (others) | filler | normal |

`hemispheric_asymmetry`, `severe_ventriculomegaly` (right), `asymmetric_ventricles` fire.
**Citation.** Barzilay 2017.

## 25. Widened extra-axial CSF space (subarachnoid space prominence)

The `extra_axial_widened` card fires when the extra-axial CSF space exceeds the GA-adjusted normal upper bound (per SPEC.md §4.6, > 95th percentile of the Kyriakopoulou 2017 extra-cerebral CSF chart). Kyriakopoulou defines the 2D extra-cerebral CSF width as skull BPD minus brain BPD. Causes: external hydrocephalus, brain volume loss, IUGR, congenital infection.

### Case EA1 — Benign external hydrocephalus pattern at 32 weeks

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 32 w 0 d | — |
| Skull BPD | 89.2 mm | >95th |
| Brain BPD | 72 mm | normal |
| Extra-axial CSF | 14 mm (above Kyriakopoulou 2017 95th centile at 32 w) | >95th |
| (others) | filler | normal |

`extra_axial_widened` fires. The IMPRESSION should suggest "external hydrocephalus / benign macrocrania of infancy — typically self-resolving."
**Citation.** Kyriakopoulou V, Vatansever D, Davidson A, et al. Normative biometry of the fetal brain using magnetic resonance imaging. *Brain Struct Funct.* 2017;222(5):2295–2307. doi:10.1007/s00429-016-1342-6.

### Case EA2 — Brain-volume-loss pattern at 30 weeks (post-CMV)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 30 w 0 d | — |
| Skull BPD | 78 mm (–2 SD) | <5th |
| Brain BPD | 74 mm | <5th |
| Atrium-R | 12 mm | >95th |
| Atrium-L | 12 mm | >95th |
| Extra-axial CSF | 14 mm | >95th |
| (others) | filler | normal |

`microcephaly_pattern`, `mild_ventriculomegaly`, `extra_axial_widened` fire — combined "brain volume loss" pattern. The IMPRESSION should suggest CMV or other intrauterine destructive insult.
**Citation.** Cannie 2016; Kyriakopoulou 2017.

### Case EA3 — Borderline extra-axial space (negative control) at 30 weeks

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 30 w 0 d | — |
| Extra-axial CSF | 10.6 mm | normal |
| (others) | filler | normal |

`extra_axial_widened` should *not* fire. Boundary verification.

### Case EA4 — Severe IUGR with widened extra-axial space at 28 weeks

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 28 w 0 d | — |
| Skull BPD | 65 mm (–3 SD) | <3rd |
| Brain BPD | 63 mm | <3rd |
| Extra-axial CSF | 14 mm | >95th |
| (others) | filler | normal |

`microcephaly_pattern`, `extra_axial_widened` fire. The IMPRESSION should reference IUGR.

### Case EA5 — Mega cisterna magna with widened extra-axial space (cross-reference)

Cross-reference: see §8 Blake's pouch cases. Mega cisterna magna may co-present with prominent supratentorial extra-axial space when intracranial pressure is reduced.

### Case EA6 — Widened extra-axial space at 36 weeks, isolated

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 36 w 0 d | — |
| Extra-axial CSF | 14 mm | >95th |
| Skull BPD | 95 mm (+2 SD) | >97th |
| (others) | filler | normal |

`extra_axial_widened`, `macrocephaly_pattern` fire. Likely benign external hydrocephalus.
**Citation.** Kyriakopoulou 2017.

## 26. Negative-control patterns (combined-card subsumption tests)

These cases verify that the engine **does not** fire combined-pattern cards when only a partial pattern is present, and that combined cards correctly *subsume* the standalone cards in the IMPRESSION when the full pattern is met.

### Case NEG1 — Mild VM with absent CSP — should *not* fire HPE pattern (insufficient features)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 28 w 0 d | — |
| Atrium-R | 11 mm | >95th |
| Atrium-L | 11 mm | >95th |
| CSP | absent | special-cased |
| Skull BPD | 74 mm | normal |
| (others) | filler | normal |

`mild_ventriculomegaly`, `csp_absent` fire. **`hpe_pattern`** must *not* fire (no monoventricle, no microcephaly, no fused thalami).

### Case NEG2 — Short CC alone — should *not* fire ACC pattern (CC partially present)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 28 w 0 d | — |
| CC | 30.0 mm (z ≈ –2.0) | <5th |
| CSP | 7.6 mm | normal |
| (others) | filler | normal |

`cc_short` fires. `acc_pattern` does *not* fire (CSP present, CC partially present, no colpocephaly).

### Case NEG3 — Severe VM alone with normal CSP and normal 3rd-V — should *not* fire aqueductal stenosis pattern

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 28 w 0 d | — |
| Atrium-R | 17 mm | >95th |
| Atrium-L | 17 mm | >95th |
| CSP | 7.6 mm | normal |
| Third ventricle | 2.0 mm | normal |
| (others) | filler | normal |

`severe_ventriculomegaly` fires. `aqueductal_stenosis_pattern` does *not* fire (3rd-V is normal).

### Case NEG4 — Mildly small TCD alone — should *not* fire DWM spectrum or PCH pattern

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 28 w 0 d | — |
| TCD | 29.5 mm (z ≈ –1.8) | <5th |
| Vermis CC | 14.8 mm | normal |
| Pons AP | 9.5 mm | normal |
| (others) | filler | normal |

`small_tcd` fires alone. Neither `dandy_walker_spectrum` nor `pch_pattern` fires (vermis and pons both normal).

### Case NEG5 — Macrocephaly alone — should *not* fire overgrowth-syndrome pattern (no thick CC, no megalencephaly, no large pons)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 32 w 0 d | — |
| Skull BPD | 95 mm | >97th |
| Brain BPD | 72 mm | normal |
| CC | 36.6 mm | normal |
| Pons AP | 11 mm | normal |
| (others) | filler | normal |

`macrocephaly_pattern` fires alone. The qualitative "overgrowth-syndrome" suggestion in the IMPRESSION should not appear without supporting features.

### Case NEG6 — Severe VM with cerebellar findings (Chiari II) but no CSA reduction — should *not* fire Chiari II / ONTD card

Cross-reference: see §23, Case CII5. Verifies the Mahalanobis-posterior gating.

## 27. Engine-stress fixtures (boundary, GA-extreme, and multi-card simultaneous-fire tests)

These cases stress-test specific aspects of the engine's arithmetic and the report-generation logic.

### Case STRESS1 — All-z = 0 fixture (every z-scored parameter exactly at the GA-specific mean)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 28 w 0 d | — |
| Skull BPD | exact μ at 28 w | normal (z = 0) |
| All other z-scored parameters | each set to the exact μ at 28 w from §7 source registry | normal (z = 0) |
| Third ventricle | 1.7 mm filler | normal raw threshold |

No DDx card fires. Every z-scored measurement should report z = 0.0 ± 0.05; the third ventricle should remain a raw-threshold auxiliary value with no z-score output. Tests the engine's arithmetic with no rounding noise.
**Citation.** Source registry §7.3 of SPEC.md (Luis 2025, Dovjak 2021, Woitek 2014) and Hertzberg 1997 for the raw third-ventricle threshold.

### Case STRESS2 — Lowest-supported GA (18 w) — confirms GA-bounds extrapolation flagging

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 18 w 0 d | — |
| Skull BPD | 40 mm | normal but **extrapolated** (Luis 2025 valid 20–40 w) |
| Brain BPD | 38 mm | extrapolated |
| All others | filler | mostly extrapolated |

The engine should fire no DDx cards because all values are within μ ± 1.645σ. Luis-only rows should display the **extrapolated-band** flag because Luis 2025 begins at 20+0, while Dovjak-covered posterior-fossa and brainstem rows remain in range at 18+0.
**Citation.** Luis 2025 valid 20–40 w; Dovjak 2021 audited range 14.0-39.3 w; the third ventricle remains a raw-threshold auxiliary input.

### Case STRESS3 — Highest-supported GA (40 w) — confirms upper-bound behaviour

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 40 w 0 d | — |
| Skull BPD | 99 mm | normal |
| Brain BPD | 96 mm | normal |
| Atrium-R | 7 mm | normal |
| Atrium-L | 7 mm | normal |
| TCD | 54.2 mm | normal |
| Vermis CC | 22.4 mm | normal |
| Pons AP | 14.6 mm | normal |
| (others) | filler | normal |

No DDx card fires. Confirms the engine handles the upper GA bound without collapse.

### Case STRESS4 — Extreme-z (z = +5) macrocephaly fixture

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 30 w 0 d | — |
| Skull BPD | 105 mm (z ≈ +5) | >99.9th |
| Brain BPD | 102 mm | >99.9th |
| Skull OFD | 145 mm | >99.9th |
| (others) | filler | normal |

`macrocephaly_pattern` fires; the engine should report z = 5.0 ± 0.5 without overflow (percentile reported as ≥99.9). Tests Φ saturation.

### Case STRESS5 — Multi-card simultaneous fire (12+ cards)

A worst-case fixture combining HPE, severe VM, cerebellar hypoplasia, vermian hypoplasia, small pons, microcephaly, third-ventricle dilatation, hemispheric asymmetry, widened extra-axial space, and short CC. Tests that the IMPRESSION renders all cards in priority order, that combined patterns subsume their components correctly, and that the report does not exceed any internal length limit.

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 26 w 0 d | — |
| Skull BPD | 60 mm (–3 SD) | <3rd |
| Skull OFD | 80 mm | <3rd |
| Brain BPD | 56 mm (–3 SD) | <3rd |
| Brain OFD-L | 78 mm | <3rd |
| Brain OFD-R | 65 mm | <3rd |
| Atrium-R | 18 mm | >95th |
| Atrium-L | 18 mm | >95th |
| CSP | absent | special-cased |
| CC | absent | special-cased |
| TCD | 25 mm (z ≈ –3) | <5th |
| Vermis CC | 9.0 mm | <5th |
| Vermis AP | 4.0 mm | <5th |
| Pons AP | 6.5 mm | <5th |
| Third ventricle | 4.5 mm | >95th |
| Extra-axial CSF | 14 mm | >95th |

Expected fires (10+ cards): `severe_ventriculomegaly`, `csp_absent`, `cc_absent`, `small_tcd`, `vermian_hypoplasia`, `small_pons`, `microcephaly_pattern`, `third_ventricle_dilatation`, `hemispheric_asymmetry`, `extra_axial_widened`, **`hpe_pattern`**, **`pch_pattern`**, **`dandy_walker_spectrum`**.

### Case STRESS6 — Low-z with multi-source disagreement (TCD consensus z ≈ +0.45, Δz ≈ 1.0)

| Parameter | Value | Expected band |
|---|---|---|
| GA | 28 w 0 d | — |
| TCD | 33.2 mm | normal |
| (others) | filler | normal |

Verifies the consensus engine flags **disagreement** (|Δz| ≥ 1 SD between Luis and Dovjak per SPEC.md §4.2.3); the report's SOURCE-AGREEMENT NOTES section must include this measurement.
**Citation.** SPEC.md §4.2 multi-source consensus engine.
